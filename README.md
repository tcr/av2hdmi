# av2hdmi

RasPi Zero code for reading an uncompressed NTSC signal and rendering it with the GPU, aka an AV to HDMI converter.

[See this project on Hackaday.io.](https://hackaday.io/project/175460-av-to-hdmi-converter)

```
cargo run; ./plot

Decoded partial capture of AV video from Sonic 3 for Genesis.

# Status

* SMI code doesn't capture a whole NTSC frame yet + occasional digital artifacts
* Decoding only implemented for CPU, not yet working on GPU shader
* Color decoding is incorrect
* Horizontal sync is incorrect
* No easy export for graph data

This code borrows heavily from [Raspberry Pi Secondary Memory Interface (SMI)](https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/)found on iosoft.blog. SMI allows a NTSC signal to be captured at a high enough frequency to preserve color subcarrier.

An easy intro to composite video decoding is [Composite video decoding: Theory and practice](https://codeandlife.com/2012/10/09/composite-video-decoding-theory-and-practice/) found on codeandlife.com. The target of this post is an FPGA, but it explains signal modulation in an approachable way.
